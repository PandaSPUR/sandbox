Introduction
============
This sandbox is based on python programming language. It is used to excute untrusted code 
that prevents arbitrary code damage your system


To run sandbox from the command line, run follow below syntax 
=============================================================
python <sandbox.py> <untrustcode.py>

It should be run in current directory of sandbox.py or insert file in front of script.


For untrusted code
==================
This sandbox is sub-language of python so it uses same systax as python language.
The tutorial for python is http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ 

However, the sandbox build base on linux or ubuntu environment so some function will not work 
on windows such as control resource on etc.
